After completing this repository, you will be able to understand the following concepts: 
- Provision an [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/ec2/) and running the model training with [CML](https://cml.dev/)
- Implement a Github actions pipeline using the previous instance. 
- Automatically log your models metrics with [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/). 
- Automatically save your training metadata on [DVC](https://dvc.org/) for easy tracking.
